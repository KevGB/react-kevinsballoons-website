      It depends on how many guests you have at the party. We estimate making balloons requires
      about 3-5 minutes on average per guest, because while some guests want a
      simple balloon, others want more complex creations. Plus, if kids are
      playing with the balloons they can pop them, so often each guest gets more
      than 1 balloon during an event.

      There is a 2 hour minimum for weekend
      events, but on week days and under special circumstances we will do
      shorter events. If you would like to be considered for a special
      circumstance, simply write the details in the “Additional Notes” area on
      the final page.
