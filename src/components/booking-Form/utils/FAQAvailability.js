      Kevin's availability is often limited, and he's often required at events abroad, but we still
      encourage you to continue booking your event. If there is a cancellation
      we will immediately let you know we can come to your event. There's usually more availability on weekdays, so consider an event at your school, daycare, or summer
      camp!
